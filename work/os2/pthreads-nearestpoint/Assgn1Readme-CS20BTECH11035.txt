PROGRAM EXECUTION DETAILS:

Compiling and starting program:

1. Open folder containing Assgn1Src-CS20BTECH11035.c  

2. Enter "gcc -pthread -o Assgn1Src-CS20BTECH11035 Assgn1Src-CS20BTECH11035.c -lm"
 in terminal to compile Assgn1Src-CS20BTECH11035.c 
3. Enter "./Assgn1Src-CS20BTECH11035" to run program.

 After Starting program :
 
1. The program prints "Enter source point in the format a,b  ,Ex:1,1" on terminal.

There we need to enter a point (x,y) in the format “x,y” otherwise the program will not give correct output.

2. The program prints “Enter number of threads” on terminal.

There we need to enter number of threads we wish to create.

3. The program prints “Enter number of points” on terminal. 

 There we need to enter number of points.

4. The program prints “Enter points in the format a,b  ,Ex:1,1.”
5. The program prints “Enter point 1”.
Enter first point in specified format.
6. The program asks to input other points similarly.
7. After giving correct input ,the program displays the time taken (in microseconds) and nearest points.
8. If more than one point are nearest to source point(at same distance ) ,all points with smallest distance from source point are printed.
